                      Entilators will be taken from certain New York hospitals
                      and redistributed to the worst-hit parts of the state

                      New York saw its highest single-day increase in deaths, up
                      by 562 to 2,935 - nearly half of all virus-related US
                      deaths recorded yesterday. The White House may advise
                      those in virus hotspots to wear face coverings in public
                      to help stem the spread.

                      City, the epicentre of the outbreak in the US, prompted Mr
                      Cuomo to say that he will order the machines be taken from
                      various parts of the state and give them to harder-hit
                      areas.

                    <p>
                      “I don’t understand why that’s not happening,” Dr Fauci
                      told CNN on Thursday. “If you look at what’s going on in
                      this country, I just don’t understand why we’re not doing

                      “You’ve got to put your foot on the accelerator to bring
                      that number down,” he added, referring to infection and

                      contradict those of President Trump, who has consistently
                      dismissed the notion of a nationwide lockdown.

                      Both the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the

                      Covid-19 is carried in airborne droplets from people
                      coughing or sneezing, but there is some dispute over how
                      far people should distance themselves from each other, and
                      whether masks are useful when used by the public.

                            The WHO advises that ordinary face masks are only
                            effective if combined with careful hand-washing and
                            social-distancing, and so far it does not recommend

                            are benefits. They argue that the public use of
                            masks can primarily help by preventing asymptomatic
                            patients - people who have been infected with
                            Covid-19 but are not aware, and not displaying any
                            symptoms - from unknowingly spreading the virus to
                            others.

                      $1,000 (£816) fine if they fail to cover their noses and
                      mouths while outside, after city officials issued an

                      The next day I came back to my team and said, This is what
                      I just heard, we have to get ready, he said. We knew that
                      it wasn’t going to be long before we were going to have to
                      deal with it.

                      Mr. Hogan has also leaned on his wife, Yumi Hogan, a
                      Korean immigrant, who was also at the governor’s
                      convention, which included a dinner at the Korean
                      ambassador’s home. As the first Korean first lady in
                      American history, Ms. Hogan has become something of an
                      icon in South Korea. I just grabbed my wife and said,
                      Look, you speak Korean. You know the president. You know
                      the first lady. You know the ambassador. Let’s talk to
                      them in Korean, and tell them we need their help.
                      Companies in South Korea said would tests.

                      Hospitals and morgues in New York are struggling to cope
                      with the pandemic, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has
                      warned that New York risks running out of ventilators for
                      patients in six days.
